# The Commit Crimes File

>This repository is a eulogy written in commits.</br>
The developer tried to erase their mistakes.</br>
Git refused. </br>
Because Nothing Truly Dies in Git.</br>

## What is this?

This repository is a **crime scene**.

A developer:
- committed things they shouldn’t have
- deleted things they regret
- rewrote history hoping nobody would notice

They were wrong.

The job, Detective is not to code.  
It is to **remember**.

---

## 🧠 How this works

- This is a **progressive Git CTF**
- Nothing is hidden behind passwords
- Everything is hidden in **plain sight**
- The answers are buried in:
  - commit history
  - deleted files
  - abandoned branches
  - forgotten configs
  - GitHub conversations

Git never forgets. It just waits.

---

## Requirements

- Git
- A terminal
- Curiosity
- Mild trust issues

You do **not** need:
- prior CTF experience
- OSINT knowledge
- advanced programming skills

---

## Rules of the Graveyard

- Do not brute force
- Do not share flags
- Do not panic if a file is missing
- All answers follow: 
- >CTF{some_flag_like_this}
